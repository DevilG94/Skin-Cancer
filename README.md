This project Skin Cancer focused on Melanoma Cancer Detection using Deep Learning Models.
This project uses a dataset of over 13,900 high-resolution images to classify skin lesions as either benign or malignant.
Key Highlights:-
Developed multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models including –
	A custom CNN Model
	CNN with Regularization
	Xception & Inception pre-trained models
	Enhanced model performance by applying techniques like Gaussian Noise, Batch Normalization and Dropout for Improved Generalization
Results:-
•	Achieved 89% Accuracy with both Xception & Inception models
•	Compared the Precision, Recall, F1-score and Accuracy of all models to evaluate their performance on Melanoma Detection.
Key Learning’s:-
1.	Leveraging pre-trained models such as Xception and Inception with Fine Tuning offers superior performance compared to custom CNN architectures.
2.	Regularization techniques significantly improved Generalization but balancing, over fitting remain crucial in medical imaging tasks.
Technologies Used:-
1)	Python, Keras, Tensorflow for building and training models.
2)	Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
3)	Implemented performance metrics and generated comparative plots for model evalution.
Conclusion:-
This project reinforced the importance of Machine Learning in Healthcare and how advanced Deep Learning models can contribute to early detection of Melanoma.
